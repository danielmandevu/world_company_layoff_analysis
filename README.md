# world_company_layoff_analysis
In this series, I want to analyse data for the world company layoffs for the year 2021 using MySQL.

1. The first step is data cleaning. 
   I imported data from the excel file into the mysql database with all column field as text  because some columns e.g total_laid_off as integers were limiting the    data import. Null values were being ignored. At first I used mysql workbench to import the data from the excel file which did not go well, so I wrote a python 
   script to handle data import.
   For the data cleaning step, check the file labeled "Data Cleaning" were I have provided comments on every sql query.

2. Exploratory analysis.
   Step two is on its way, hang on.
